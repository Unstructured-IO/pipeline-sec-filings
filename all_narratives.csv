RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"You should carefully consider the risks described in this section. Our future performance is subject to risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. We may be subject to other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us. In addition, please see our note about forward-looking statements included in the MD&A."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Our revenue is subject to volatility in metal prices, which could negatively affect our results of operations or cash flow."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Market prices for gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals may fluctuate widely over time and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include metal supply and demand, industrial and jewelry fabrication, investment demand, central banking actions, inflation expectations, currency values, interest rates, forward sales by metal producers, and political, trade, economic, or banking conditions."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Our revenue is directly tied to metal prices and is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of gold, as we derive a majority of our revenue from gold stream and royalty interests. Under our stream agreements, we purchase metal at a fixed price or a stated percentage of the market price and then sell the metal in the open market. If market prices decline, our revenue and cash flow from metal sales decline. A price decline can also impact our revenue under certain sliding-scale royalty agreements as we may receive a lower royalty rate when prices fall below specified thresholds. In addition, some"
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"of our royalty agreements are based on the operator’s concentrate sales to smelters and allow for price adjustments between the operator and the smelter based on metals prices on a future date, typically three to five months after shipment of concentrate. These price adjustments can decrease our revenue in future periods if metal prices decline following shipment."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Price declines could cause an operator to reduce, suspend, or terminate production or development at a project, which would impact our future revenue from the project. These production or development decisions could prevent us from recovering our initial investment in the project or result in an impairment to the value of our initial investment."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,We own nonoperating interests in mining properties and cannot ensure properties are developed or operated in our best interests.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Our revenue is derived entirely from stream and royalty interests in properties owned and operated by third parties. In general, we have no decision-making authority regarding the development or operation of the mineral properties underlying our stream and royalty interests. Operators make all development and operating decisions, including decisions about permitting, feasibility analysis, mine design and operation, processing, plant and equipment matters, and temporary or permanent suspension of operations. The interests of the operators and those of Royal Gold on the relevant properties are not always aligned, which can result in lower or delayed payments to us compared to what we anticipated."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"The continuing COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the global economy, global markets, and operations at some properties in which we have stream or royalty interests over the past year and a half and may continue to do so; this could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and the trading price of our stock."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"The world continues to experience a deadly outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. The global economy, metal prices, and financial markets experienced significant volatility and uncertainty over the past year and a half due to COVID-19, including due to the recent emergence of variant strains of the virus. Continuing travel restrictions due to COVID-19 could limit or delay acquisition opportunities or other business activities. In addition, economic volatility, labor shortages, disruptions in the financial markets, or severe price declines for gold or other metals could adversely affect our ability to obtain future debt or equity financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Although conditions have improved in the U.S., Canada, and Switzerland where we have employees, other parts of the world, including areas where we have stream and royalty interests, continue to be impacted by the pandemic. At varying locations and times, public health and government authorities have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including in some cases quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and restrictions on mining-related activities. Throughout fiscal year 2021, several of our operating counterparties instituted temporary operational curtailments due to the pandemic, including the operators of Mount Milligan, Pueblo Viejo and Peñasquito. There may be additional curtailments. In addition, the pandemic and resulting economic and societal impacts have at times made it difficult for operators to forecast expected production amounts. The effects of the pandemic will ultimately depend on many factors that are outside of our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of the virus, government and operator actions in response to the pandemic, and the development, availability, and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines. As a result, we are currently unable to predict the nature or extent of any future impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or the trading price of our stock."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We often have limited access to data about operating properties, which may make it difficult for us to project or assess the performance of our stream and royalty interests or to confirm mineral reserves."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We often do not have the contractual right to receive production, operating, and other data, nor do we have the right to access the property or obtain drilling and metallurgical data that would allow us to confirm reserves applicable to the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests. As a result, it may be difficult for us to project or assess the performance of a stream or royalty interest and leaves us unable to conduct our own reserve or resource analysis."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Our stream and royalty interests may not result in the anticipated returns or may not otherwise ultimately benefit our business.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We are continually reviewing opportunities to acquire new stream and royalty interests, and we have acquisition opportunities at various stages of review. Any acquisition could be material to us. At times, we also consider opportunities to restructure our existing stream or royalty interests where we believe the restructuring would provide a long-term benefit to us, even though it could reduce near-term revenues or result in the incurrence of transaction-related costs. The success of our stream and royalty interests is based in part on our ability to make accurate assumptions at the time of acquisition about the amount and timing of revenue to be derived from those interests. These assumptions are based on a variety of factors, including the geological, metallurgical, permitting, environmental, and other aspects of the project. For development projects, we also make assumptions about the cost, timing, and conduct of development. If an operator fails to bring a project into production as expected or if actual performance otherwise falls short of our assumptions, our revenue derived from the project may not be sufficient to yield an adequate, or any, return on our investment. In addition, we could be required to decrease the carrying value of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot ensure that any acquisition or other transaction will ultimately benefit Royal Gold."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Our future success depends on our ability to acquire additional stream or royalty interests at appropriate valuations.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Our future success depends largely on our ability to acquire additional stream and royalty interests at appropriate valuations. We may not be able to identify and complete acquisitions of additional interests at appropriate prices or terms. We may not have sufficient liquidity or may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing to fund acquisitions due to economic volatility, credit crises, declines in metal prices, or other reasons. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, and we may not be able to compete effectively against them. In addition, there has been significant growth in the number of stream and royalty companies over the last several years and some of these companies have different investment criteria, which has made the industry more competitive at times. Changes to tax rules, accounting policies, or the treatment of stream interests by ratings agencies could make streams or royalties less attractive to counterparties."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"For some operating properties, we may not realize all of the expected benefits of our investments if operators are unable to replace current mineral reserves as they are depleted, which could impact our future results of operations."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"For some operating properties, our return on investment depends in part on the operators’ ability to replace mineral reserves as they are consumed in the ordinary course of mining. If current mineral reserves are not replaced as they are mined by the operators of these properties, whether through expansion of known deposits, discovery of new mineralized material through exploration, conversion of mineralized material to mineral reserves, or otherwise, our expected investment returns or future results of operations could be adversely affected."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"A significant portion of our revenue comes from a small number of operating properties, which means that adverse developments at these properties could have a more significant or lasting impact on our results of operations than if our revenue was less concentrated."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Approximately 77% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021 came from six properties: Mount Milligan, Andacollo, Pueblo Viejo, Wassa, Peñasquito, and Cortez. We expect these properties to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue going forward. This concentration of revenue could mean that adverse developments, including any adverse decisions made by the operators, at one or more of these properties could have a more significant or longer-term impact on our results of operations than if our revenue was less concentrated."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,A significant disruption to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We rely on a variety of information technology and automated operating systems to manage and support our operations. For example, we depend on our information technology systems for financial reporting, operational and investment management, and email. These systems contain our proprietary business information and personally identifiable"
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"information of our employees. The proper functioning of these systems and the security of this data is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. In addition, these systems could require modifications or upgrades as a result of technological changes or growth in our business. These changes could be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Our systems, and those of third-party providers, could be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses, ransomware or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access, or cyber-attacks. Any security breach could compromise our networks, and the information stored on them could be improperly accessed, disclosed, lost, or stolen. Because techniques used to sabotage, obtain unauthorized access to systems or prohibit authorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not detected until successfully launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and the steps that we have taken to secure our systems and electronic information may not be adequate to prevent a disruption or attack. Any unauthorized activities could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or result in legal claims or proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or operating results."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We depend on the services of our executives and other key employees, and the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We believe that our success depends on retaining qualified executives and other key employees. Our management team has significant industry and company-specific experience. If we are unsuccessful at retaining or attracting qualified personnel, our business could be disrupted and our ability to achieve our business objectives and grow effectively could be jeopardized. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of our directors or employees."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Our revenue is subject to operational and other risks faced by operators of the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We generally are not required to pay capital or operating costs on projects in which we hold stream or royalty interests. However, our revenue and the value of our investments are indirectly subject to hazards and risks normally associated with developing and operating mining properties, including the following:"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,insufficient ore reserves
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,increased capital or operating costs
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"declines in the price of gold, silver, copper, nickel, or other metals"

RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"insolvency, bankruptcy, or other financial difficulty of the operator"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,changes in laws or regulations or the enforcement of laws or regulations
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"The occurrence of any of these events could negatively impact operations at the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Most of our revenue is derived from properties outside the United States, and risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries or other sovereign jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Approximately 89% of our revenue comes from properties outside of the United States, and many of our operators are organized outside of the United States. Our principal producing stream and royalty interests on properties outside of the United States are located in Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ghana and Mexico. Within the United States and other countries, indigenous people may be recognized as sovereign entities and may enforce their own laws and regulations. Our and operators’ activities are subject to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries or other sovereign jurisdictions, including the following:"

RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,suspension of the enforcement of creditors’ or stockholders’ rights
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"loss of access to government-controlled infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rails, ports, power sources, and water supplies"
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"In addition, many of our operators are organized outside of the United States. Our stream and royalty interests may be subject to the application of foreign laws to our operators, and their stockholders, including laws relating to foreign ownership structures, corporate transactions, creditors’ rights, bankruptcy and liquidation. Foreign operations also could be adversely impacted by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"These risks may limit or disrupt the development or operation of properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests or impair our rights or interests in these properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"If the assumptions underlying operators’ production, reserve, or mineralized material estimates are inaccurate or if future events cause operators to negatively adjust their previous estimates, our future revenue or the value of our investments could be adversely affected."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"The operators of the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests generally prepare production and reserve estimates for the properties. We do not independently prepare or verify this information. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in these estimates, many of which are outside the operators’ control. As a result, production and reserve estimates are subjective and necessarily depend upon a number of assumptions, including, among others, reliability of historical data, geologic and mining conditions, metallurgical recovery, metal prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, development and reclamation costs, mining technology improvements, and the effects of government regulation. If any of the assumptions that operators make in connection with production or reserve estimates are incorrect, actual production could be significantly lower than the production or reserve estimates, which could adversely affect our future revenue and the value of our investments. In addition, if operators’ estimates with respect to the timing of production are incorrect, we may experience variances in expected revenue from period to period."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Some operators also report publicly or to us estimates of mineralized material. The term “mineralized material” does not indicate proven or probable reserves as defined by the SEC. Mineralized material is subject to future exploration and development and associated risks and may never convert to future reserves. In addition, estimates of mineralized material are subject to similar uncertainties and assumptions as discussed above with respect to mineral reserves."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We and our operating properties may be subject to environmental risks, including risks associated with climate change, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or the value of our interests or of our common stock."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Mining operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment. In addition, many countries have implemented laws and regulations designed to address the effects of climate change, including rules to reduce industrial emissions and increase energy efficiency. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving in a manner generally expected to result in stricter standards, more liability, and increased costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations can impose substantial costs and burdens on operators of properties subject to our interests. In addition, an operator’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in injunctive action, orders to suspend or cease operations, damages, or civil or criminal penalties on the operator. If any of these events were to occur, our revenue or the value of our interests could be adversely affected."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Climate change may also pose physical risks to the properties in which we hold an interest. This could include adverse effects on operations as a result of increasing occurrences of extreme weather events, water shortages, changes in rainfall and storm patterns, changes in sea levels, and other negative weather and climate patterns. For example, the Mount Milligan mine has experienced a reduction in production due to water shortages in recent years."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"In addition, public-company stockholders are increasingly sensitive to the climate change impacts and mitigation efforts of companies, are increasingly seeking enhanced disclosure on the risks, challenges, governance implications, and financial impacts of climate change faced by companies and demanding that companies take a proactive approach to addressing perceived environmental risks, including risks associated with climate change, relating to their operations. Adverse publicity or climate-related litigation that impacts any of the operators of the properties in which we hold interests could have a negative impact on our business. As a holder of stream and royalty interests, we generally will not have any influence on litigation such as this and generally will not have access to non-public information concerning such litigation."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Challenges relating to climate change could have an impact on the ability of these operators to access the capital markets and such limitations could have a corresponding negative effect on their business and operations. Although we do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests and are not required to contribute to environmental or other operating costs on the properties, our stockholders may nonetheless demand that we bear some responsibility for managing these environmental risks. If this were to occur, the value of our interests or your shares of common stock could be adversely affected."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Further, due to expansive environmental laws, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities for historic periods during which we owned or operated properties or relative to our current ownership interests in lease and underlying unpatented mining claims. These liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"As of June 30, 2021, we had $1 billion available and no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Future indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, or dividends"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,restrict us from exploiting business opportunities
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,require the consent of our existing lenders to incur additional indebtedness
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"limit our ability to borrow additional funds for acquisitions, working capital, or debt-service requirements"
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Our credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants. For example, the agreement includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as these terms are defined under the agreement). These covenants could limit our ability to engage in activities that are in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default that, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. Our credit facility expires in July 2026. In the future, we may be unable to obtain new financing or refinancing on acceptable terms."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"The proposed phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of calendar year 2021. The Federal Reserve Board has convened a group of private-market participants to identify a proposed alternative rate and address the transition from LIBOR to an alternative rate. In 2019, the FASB proposed guidance that would help facilitate the market transition from existing reference rates to alternative rates. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Under the agreement governing the facility, we have established provisions to provide for the eventual replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate under the facility. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future use of LIBOR or a replacement rate. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent a LIBOR change would impact our future results of operations and financial condition."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Unknown defects in our stream or royalty interests or the bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Despite our due diligence practices, it is possible that unknown defects or problems will exist relating to the existence, validity, enforceability, terms, or geographic extent of our stream and royalty interests. Similarly, stream interests and, in many jurisdictions, royalty interests are or can be contractual in nature, rather than interests in land. As a result, these interests may not survive a bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator. We often do not have the protection of security interests that could help us recover all or part of our investment in a stream or royalty interest in the event of an operator’s"
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"bankruptcy or insolvency. If our stream or royalty interests were set aside through judicial or administrative proceedings, the value of our investments could be adversely affected."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Some of the agreements governing our stream and royalty interests contain terms that reduce or cap the revenue generated from those interests.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Revenue from some of our stream and royalty interests decreases or stops after threshold production, delivery, or payment milestones are achieved. For example, our stream interests at Pueblo Viejo, Andacollo, Wassa, and Khoemacau and certain of our royalty interests at other properties contain these types of limitations. As a result, past production and revenue relating to these interests may not be indicative of future results. In addition, some of our stream and royalty interests do not cover all of the reserves at certain properties, which could mean that overall performance reported by the operators may not correlate to the performance of our interests in the properties."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Operators may fail to comply with their contractual arrangements with us or may interpret their obligations in a manner adverse to us, which could decrease our revenue or increase our costs."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"At times, operators may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. In addition, we often rely on the operators for the calculation of our stream deliveries or royalty payments and there is a risk of delay, error, and additional expense in receiving deliveries or payments. Payments may be delayed by restrictions imposed by lenders, delays in the sale or delivery of products, or the ability or willingness of smelters and refiners to process mine products. Our rights to payment under our royalty and stream agreements must, in most cases, be enforced by contract. When we enter into new stream or royalty agreements, we attempt to secure contractual rights that allow us to monitor operators’ compliance with their obligations to us, such as audit or access rights. However, these rights may not be sufficient to ensure compliance. In addition, our stream and royalty agreements are often complex and may be subject to interpretation or uncertainties. Operators and other counterparties may interpret our interests in a manner adverse to us. For these or other reasons, we could be forced to expend resources or take legal action to enforce our contractual rights. We may not be successful in enforcing our contractual rights. As a result, our revenue relating to the disputed interests could be adversely affected. We may also need to expend significant monetary and human resources to defend our position, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may be required to make retroactive revenue adjustments in future periods relating to past period revenue as a result of information that we learn through audit or access rights."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Changes to U.S. and foreign tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We are subject to tax in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and their interpretation subject to a significant change in any jurisdiction. We cannot predict the timing or significance of future tax law changes in the U.S. or other countries in which we do business. If material tax law changes are enacted, our future effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely impacted."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Anti-corruption laws and regulations could subject us to liability and require us to incur costs.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to third parties, including foreign governments and their officials, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In some cases, we invest in mining operations in jurisdictions that have experienced corruption in the past. Our international investment activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments in violation of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by one of our employees or agents in violation of our policies. In addition, the operators of the properties in which we own stream and royalty interests may fail to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations. Although we do not operate these properties, enforcement authorities could deem us to have some culpability for the operators’ actions. Any violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could result in significant civil or criminal penalties to us and could have an adverse effect on our reputation."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We expect that our disclosures relating to operating properties will change as a result of new SEC disclosure rules, and we continue to face uncertainty around how some of these rules apply to a stream and royalty company."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"In 2018, the SEC adopted amendments to its disclosure requirements for mining companies, including stream and royalty companies. We are required to comply with the new rules for our fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2021. We expect that our disclosures about operating properties will change under the new rules, and, in some cases, we may be required to disclose in our SEC filings more or less information than we currently disclose about these properties. There continues to be uncertainty about how the rules will apply to a stream and royalty company with significant investments in properties run by international operators that are not required to report under SEC rules."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"Our stock price may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future. For example, during fiscal year 2021, the market price of our common stock ranged from a low of $99.32 to a high of $147.64. Many factors unrelated to operating performance can contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock, including the following:"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"economic, market, or political conditions, including the effects of COVID-19"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"market prices of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,developments relating to operating properties
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,interest rates and expectations about inflation
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,currency values
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,credit market conditions
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"These market fluctuations, regardless of cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We may issue additional equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders and reduce our per-share financial measures and could reduce the market price of our common stock."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We may issue additional equity in the future in connection with acquisitions, strategic transactions, or for other purposes. If we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted and our per-share financial measures would be reduced. In addition, shares of common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions. The market price of our common stock could decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We may change our practice of paying dividends, which could reduce the value of your investment."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"We have paid a cash dividend on our common stock since calendar year 2000. Our board of directors has discretion in determining whether to declare a dividend based on a number of factors, including metal prices, economic or market conditions, earnings, cash flow, financial condition, and funding requirements for future opportunities or operations. In addition, corporate law limitations or future contractual restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future. If our board of directors reduces or eliminates future dividends, our stock price could fall, and the success of your investment would depend largely on any future stock price appreciation. We have increased our dividend in prior years. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to do so or that we will pay any dividends."
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Provisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose barriers to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of"
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"our board of directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Among other things, these provisions provide for the following:"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"allow our board of directors to issue shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, except as may be required by Nasdaq rules"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,allow our board of directors to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued preferred stock
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,"provide for a classified board, whereby our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms"
RISK_FACTORS,ListItem,prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders

PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"Copper stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 16.9 million pounds during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to approximately 12.7 million pounds during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Increased deliveries resulted from differences in the timing of shipments and settlements during the periods, in addition to higher tonnage and higher copper grades processed, slightly offset by lower copper recovery."
PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"Centerra reported in May that given productivity improvements, cost controls and brownfield exploration success, it was updating the Mount Milligan life of mine plan. On August 10, 2021, Centerra reported that exploration activity is ongoing and results from drilling during the quarter ended June 30, 2021, include significant mineralization at several targets below the ultimate open pit boundary and along the eastern and southeastern margins of the open pit."
PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"With respect to water supply, on August 10, 2021, Centerra reported that Mount Milligan accessed water from surface water sources and groundwater wells near the tailings storage facility in the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and with stored water inventory in excess of eight million cubic meters it estimates that Mount Milligan has sufficient water to enable continuous production for at least twelve months. Centerra also reported that it continues to pursue a longer-term solution to its water requirements at Mount Milligan and is in discussions with regulators, First Nations partners and other stakeholders. Centerra reported that in the first half of calendar year 2021 it obtained an environmental assessment certificate amendment and related permits to access surface water sources for Mount Milligan through November 2023."

PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"Gold stream deliveries from Pueblo Viejo were approximately 40,800 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to approximately 45,000 ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was attributable to lower tonnes processed, lower ore grades and lower recovery in fiscal year 2021."
PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"Silver stream deliveries were approximately 1.5 million ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to approximately 1.7 million ounces of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was attributable to lower silver recoveries resulting from temporary operational issues with the silver circuit that caused recoveries to fall below the fixed 70% recovery rate specified in the stream agreement. The stream agreement includes a deferral mechanism for ounces that cannot be delivered at this fixed recovery rate, with the economic impact of any shortfall in deliveries to be made up in future periods. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 437,000 ounces of silver deliveries have been deferred. Barrick has advised that maintenance work on the silver recovery circuit is complete and silver recovery has steadily improved over the past quarter. Barrick also advised that modifications to further improve"
PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"silver recovery are underway and are expected to be complete during the current quarter. With the recovery improvements, we expect delivery of the deferred ounces to begin next quarter."
PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"Barrick reported continued progress at Pueblo Viejo during the June 2021 quarter to expand the process plant and tailings storage facilities. Barrick estimates that the expansion project could significantly increase throughput and allow the mine to maintain average annual gold production of approximately 800,000 ounces after calendar year 2022 (on a 100% basis), and that the increase in tailings storage capacity has the potential to convert over 9 million ounces of mineralized material to reserves (on a 100% basis). Barrick reported that as of June 30, 2021, the engineering design of the process plant expansion is 87% complete, construction is 10% complete, and completion of the process plant expansion is expected by the end of calendar 2022. Barrick also reported an agreement with key stakeholders to allow independent government-led oversight of the strategic environmental and social impact assessment studies for the new tailings storage facility, which is an important first step in starting fieldwork and advancing the permitting process."
PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,Barrick expects the proportion of lower grade stockpile ore in the feed blend to steadily increase until the mine expansion pits are fully developed as part of the decision on the proposed plant and tailings expansion project.
PROPERTIES,NarrativeText,"In calendar year 2021, gold production from Barrick’s 60% interest in Pueblo Viejo is expected to be between 470,000 and 510,000 ounces, compared to actual gold production of 542,000 ounces in calendar year 2020."

MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"A discussion of the changes in our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, and 2019, has been omitted from this report, but may be found in Item 7, MD&A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020, filed with the SEC on August 6, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.royalgold.com."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We acquire and manage precious metal streams, royalties, and similar interests. We seek to acquire existing stream and royalty interests or finance projects that are in production or in the development stage in exchange for stream or royalty interests."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,We manage our business under two segments:
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,ListItem,"Acquisition and Management of Stream Interests — A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. As of June 30, 2021, we owned eight stream interests, which are on six producing properties and two development stage properties. Stream interests accounted for 69% and 72% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30 2021, and 2020, respectively. We expect stream interests to continue representing a significant portion of our total revenue."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,ListItem,"Acquisition and Management of Royalty Interests — Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. As of June 30, 2021, we owned royalty interests on 35 producing properties, 15 development stage properties and 129 exploration stage properties, of which we consider 50 to be evaluation stage projects. We use “evaluation stage” to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the search for reserves. Royalty interests accounted for 31% and 28% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests, and we generally are not required to contribute to capital costs, exploration costs, environmental costs or other operating costs on those properties."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We are continually reviewing opportunities to grow our portfolio, whether through the creation or acquisition of new or existing stream or royalty interests or other acquisition activity. We generally have acquisition opportunities in various stages of review. Our review process may include, for example, engaging consultants and advisors to analyze an opportunity; analysis of technical, financial, legal, and other confidential information of an opportunity; submission of indications of interest and term sheets; participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations; and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold, silver, copper, and other metals. Metal prices have fluctuated widely in recent years and we expect this volatility to continue. The marketability and price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, and significant changes in metal prices can have a material effect on our revenue."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, average metal prices and percentages of revenue by metal were as follows:"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Throughout calendar year 2020 and into calendar year 2021, several of our operating counterparties have instituted temporary operational curtailments due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the pandemic and resulting economic and societal impacts have made it difficult for operators to forecast expected production amounts and, at times, operators have had to withdraw or revise previously disclosed guidance. For the most part, our results of operations and financial condition have not been materially impacted by these measures to date. However, the effects of the pandemic will ultimately depend on many factors that are outside of our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the emergence of variant strains of the virus, government and operator actions in response to the pandemic, and the development, availability, and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines. As a result, we are currently unable to predict the nature or extent of any future impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of developments associated with the pandemic on stream and royalty interests as part of our regular asset impairment analysis."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On September 30, 2020, we announced an agreement with Kinross to sell our interest in the Manh Choh Project (formerly known as the Peak Gold Project) and our common share position in Contango Ore, Inc. (“Contango”), our partner in Peak Gold, LLC and owner of the Manh Choh Project. Consideration received for the sale of these interests included cash of $61.3 million, an incremental 28% net smelter return royalty on silver produced from an area of interest which includes the current Manh Choh Project resource area, and an incremental 1% net smelter return royalty on certain State of Alaska mining claims acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of Contango in the transaction. Peak Gold, LLC retains the right to acquire 50% of the incremental 28% net smelter return royalty on silver for $4 million."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"After this transaction, our interests in the Manh Choh Project and State of Alaska mining claim property owned by Contango consist solely of net smelter return royalties. Refer to Note 3 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the sale of the Peak Gold JV interest."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On October 1, 2020, we announced the separation of the Wassa gold stream and the Prestea and Bogoso gold streams into two separate stream agreements effective September 30, 2020. This separation was completed to facilitate the sale by Golden Star Resources Ltd. (“Golden Star”) of the Prestea and Bogoso mines to Future Global Resources Limited (“FGR”). Refer to Note 4 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the separation of the Wassa and Prestea and Bogoso stream agreement."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On January 6, 2021, we made the sixth advance payment of $32.6 million toward the Khoemacau Project silver stream. With this payment, we have completed the total $212 million advance payment required to earn the base silver stream of 80% of payable silver. A seventh advance payment of $10.6 million was made toward the option silver stream on April 7, 2021, and as of that date, we hold the right to purchase 84% of the payable silver from Khoemacau until the delivery of approximately 33.6 million ounces of silver, and 42% thereafter."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On June 7, 2021, we acquired a 1.0% net smelter return royalty on certain claims covering the Côté Gold Project in Northern Ontario, Canada. The Côté Gold Project is owned 92.5% by the Côté Gold Joint Venture (a joint venture owned 70% by IAMGOLD Corporation and 30% by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd.), and 7.5% by a third party. The royalty covers the Chester 3 claims, which in turn cover approximately 70% of the current reserves of the Côté Gold Project, as well as other areas outside the current project area. Royal Gold acquired the royalty from a third-party royalty holder for $75 million in cash consideration."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On June 30, 2021, we announced that we entered into a precious metals purchase agreement for gold produced from the NX Gold Mine in Brazil (“NX Gold Stream”) with Ero Gold Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ero Copper Corp., and certain of its affiliates (together, “Ero”)."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On August 6, 2021, we made an advance payment of $100 million upon closing of the transaction. We will make up to an additional $10 million of further payments from the beginning of calendar year 2022 through the end of calendar year 2024 based on Ero’s achievement of meeting success-based targets related to regional exploration and resource additions. In return, we will receive 25% of the gold produced from the NX Gold Mine until the delivery of 93,000 ounces, and 10% thereafter. We will pay 20% of the spot gold price for each ounce delivered until the delivery of 49,000 ounces, and 40% of the spot gold price thereafter."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"A delivery of approximately 2,500 ounces of gold based on mine production through to closing is expected to be received from Ero within five business days of closing the transaction."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On August 9, 2021, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 effective as of December 31, 2021. As a result, we expect to file a Transitional Report on Form 10-KT in February 2022 for the six-month stub period from July 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We received annual production estimates from many of the operators of our producing mines during the first calendar quarter of 2021. In some instances, an operator may revise its original calendar year guidance throughout the year. The following table shows these production estimates for our principal producing properties for calendar year 2021 as well as the actual production reported to us by the various operators through June 30, 2021. The estimates and production reports are prepared by the operators. We do not participate in the preparation or calculation of the operators’ estimates or production reports and have not independently assessed or verified, and disclaim all responsibility for, the accuracy of this information. Please refer to Part I, Item 2, Properties, of this report for further discussion on any updates at our principal producing properties."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Production estimates received from our operators are for calendar year 2021. There can be no assurance that production estimates received from our operators will be achieved. Please also refer to our cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements following this MD&A, as well as the Risk Factors identified in Part I, Item 1A, of this report for information regarding factors that could affect actual results."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Actual production figures shown are from our operators and cover the period January 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021, unless otherwise noted in footnotes to this table."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The actual production figure shown for Andacollo is contained gold in concentrate. The estimated production figure was not available on the date of this report.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The estimated and actual production figures shown for Mount Milligan are payable gold and copper in concentrate.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The estimated and actual production figures shown for Pueblo Viejo are payable gold in doré and represent the 60% interest in Pueblo Viejo held by Barrick. The operator did not provide estimated or actual silver production.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The estimated and actual production figures shown for Wassa is payable gold in doré.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The estimated and actual gold and silver production figures shown for Peñasquito are payable gold and silver in concentrate and doré. The estimated and actual lead and zinc production figures shown are payable lead and zinc in concentrate.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"The following table discloses historical production for the past two fiscal years for the principal producing properties that are subject to our stream and royalty interests, as reported to us by the operators of the mines. We do not participate in the"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"preparation or calculation of the operators’ production reports and have not independently assessed or verified, and disclaim all responsibility for, the accuracy of such information."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Historical production for our stream interests relates to the amount of stream metal sales for each fiscal year presented and may differ from stream deliveries discussed in Item 2, Properties, or from the operators’ public reporting. For our royalty interests, historical production relates to the payable metal amounts as reported to us by the operators of the mines subject to our royalty rate for each fiscal year presented."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recorded net income attributable to Royal Gold stockholders of $302.5 million, or $4.61 per basic share and $4.60 per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to Royal Gold stockholders of $199.3 million, or $3.04 per basic share and $3.03 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in our earnings per share was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in revenue, (ii) a one-time gain attributable to the sale of our Peak Gold JV interest during the September 2020 quarter and (iii) various discrete income tax benefits recognized during the September 2020 and June 2021 quarters. These increases were partially offset by increases in our cost of sales and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, each discussed further below."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized total revenue of $615.9 million, which is comprised of stream revenue of $424.0 million and royalty revenue of $191.9 million, at an average gold price of $1,849 per ounce, an average silver price of $25.38 per ounce and an average copper price of $3.60 per pound, compared to total revenue of $498.8 million, which is comprised of stream revenue of $359.9 million and royalty revenue of $138.9 million, at an average gold price of $1,560 per ounce, an average silver price of $16.90 per ounce and an average copper price of $2.57 per pound, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Revenue and the corresponding production, attributable to our stream and royalty interests, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 is as follows:"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"(In thousands, except reported production in ozs. and lbs.)"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Reported production relates to the amount of metal sales, subject to our stream and royalty interests, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and may differ from the operators’ public reporting."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Individually, with the exception of the Rainy River stream (5.5% in fiscal year 2021 and 2020), no stream or royalty included within the “Other” category contributed greater than 5% of our total revenue for either period."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"The increase in our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, resulted primarily from an increase in the average gold, silver and copper prices compared to the prior period and an increase in production within the royalty segment."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Gold and silver ounces and copper pounds purchased and sold during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, as well as gold, silver and copper in inventory as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, for our stream interests were as follows:"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Cost of sales increased to $92.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $83.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the gold, silver and copper prices and an increase in copper sales at Mount Milligan when compared to the prior period. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in gold sales at Mount Milligan and Andacollo when compared to the prior period. Cost of sales, which excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, is specific to our stream agreements and is the result of our purchase of gold, silver and copper for a cash payment. The cash payment for gold from Mount Milligan is the lesser of $435 per ounce or the prevailing market price of gold when purchased, while the cash payment for our other streams is a set contractual percentage of the gold, silver or copper (Mount Milligan) spot price near the date of metal delivery."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"General and administrative costs decreased to $28.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $30.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to additional non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $3.3 million recognized in the prior year period due to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in connection with the retirement of our former President and Chief Executive Officer and our former Vice President and General Counsel in January 2020."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Exploration costs decreased to $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $5.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Exploration costs were specific to the exploration and advancement of the Peak Gold JV. On September 30, 2020, we sold our Peak Gold JV interest which is discussed earlier in this MD&A and Note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $183.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $175.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher copper sales at Mount Milligan and an increase in depletion rates at Mount Milligan through the six months ended December 31, 2020, as previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization was offset by a decrease in gold sales at Mount Milligan and Andacollo."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We recognized a gain in fair value changes in equity securities of $6.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to a gain in fair value changes in equity securities of $1.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of marketable equity securities as discussed further in Note 5 of our notes to consolidated financial statements."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Interest and other expense decreased to $6.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $9.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense as a result of a decrease in average debt amounts outstanding during the current period when compared to the prior period. Refer to Note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized income tax expense totaling $36.9 million, compared with an income tax benefit of $3.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.9% during the current period, compared with (1.9%) in the prior period. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, was primarily impacted by the release of uncertain tax liabilities resulting from settlement agreements with foreign tax authorities in various jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, was primarily impacted by a net step-up of tax assets due to the enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland (Swiss Tax Reform) and the release of an uncertain tax liability resulting from a settlement agreement with a foreign tax authority."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"At June 30, 2021, we had current assets of $297.1 million compared to current liabilities of $52.1 million resulting in working capital of $245.0 million and a current ratio of 6 to 1. This compares to current assets of $362.2 million and current liabilities of $43.6 million at June 30, 2020, resulting in working capital of $318.6 million and a current ratio of approximately 8 to 1. The decrease in our working capital was primarily attributable to the repayment of our outstanding debt, which is discussed further below under “Summary of Cash Flows.”"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, liquidity needs were met from $407.2 million in net cash provided by operating activities and our available cash resources. As of June 30, 2021, we had $1 billion available and no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Working capital, combined with available capacity under our revolving credit facility, resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of total liquidity at June 30, 2021. Refer to Note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and below (“Recent Liquidity and Capital Resource Developments”) for further discussion on our debt. In August 2021, we borrowed $100 million under our revolving credit facility for business development activities and have $900 million available."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We believe that our current financial resources and operating cash flows will be adequate to cover our operating needs for the foreseeable future. Our current financial resources are also available to fund dividends and for acquisitions of stream and royalty interests, including any conditional funding schedules. Our long-term capital requirements are primarily affected by our ongoing acquisition activities. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review. In the event of one or more substantial stream or royalty interest or other acquisitions, we may seek additional debt or equity financing as necessary. We occasionally borrow and repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and may do so in the future."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Please refer to our risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risks that may impact our liquidity and capital resources."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On July 7, 2021, we entered into a fourth amendment to our revolving credit facility dated as of June 2, 2017. The amendment extends the maturity date from June 3, 2024, to July 7, 2026, adds provisions to provide for the eventual replacement of LIBOR and makes certain changes to the lenders under the agreement."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"On November 17, 2020, we announced an increase in our annual dividend for calendar year 2021 from $1.12 to $1.20, payable on a quarterly basis of $0.30 per share. The newly declared dividend is 7% higher than the dividend paid during calendar year 2020. We have steadily increased our annual dividend for 20 years, or since calendar year 2001. We expect to pay our annual dividend using cash on hand."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $407.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $340.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from our stream and royalty interests, net of cost of sales and production taxes, of approximately $86.1 million over the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This increase was offset by $27.4 million of higher cash taxes paid, net of refunds over the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in cash taxes paid during the current period is primarily attributable to an increase in required estimated tax payments due to increased taxable income and payments that were deferred due to COVID-19."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Net cash used in investing activities totaled $116.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $152.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $49.2 million received for the sale of our Peak Gold JV investment and $21.3 million for the sale of equity securities. This decrease was partially offset by the $18.0 million KCM drew against the subordinated debt facility."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Net cash used in financing activities totaled $383.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $11.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in repayments on our revolving credit facility. We repaid $305.0 million on our revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $115.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021, were as follows:"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The above table does not include stream commitments as discussed in Note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements. We believe we will be able to fund all current obligations from net cash provided by operating activities.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,We do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Listed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Please also refer to Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"The preparation of our financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators of the properties on which we hold stream and royalty interests. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long-lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. These estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we recognize revenue or charge depreciation, depletion and amortization to earnings. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Differences between estimates and actual amounts are adjusted and recorded in the period that the actual amounts are known."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Stream and royalty interests include acquired stream and royalty interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. The costs of acquired stream and royalty interests are capitalized as tangible assets as such interests do not meet the definition of a financial asset."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Production stage stream and royalty interests are depleted using the units of production method over the life of the mineral property (as stream sales occur or royalty payments are recognized), which are estimated using proven and probable reserves as provided by the operator. Development stage mineral properties, which are not yet in production, are not depleted until the property begins production. Exploration stage mineral properties, where there are no proven and probable reserves, are not depleted. At such time as the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable reserves, the mineral property is depleted over its life, using proven and probable reserves."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value of stream and royalty interests in production and development stage mineral properties is evaluated based upon estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from each stream and royalty interest using estimates of proven and probable reserves and other relevant information received from the operators. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in exploration stage mineral properties in the event of significant decreases in the price of gold, silver, copper and other metals, and whenever new information regarding the mineral properties is obtained from the operator indicating that production will not likely occur or may be reduced in the future, thus potentially affecting the future recoverability of our stream or royalty interests. Impairments in the carrying value of each property are measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each property exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Estimates of gold, silver, copper, and other metal prices, and operators’ estimates of proven and probable reserves or mineralized material related to our stream or royalty properties are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our investment in these stream and royalty interests in mineral properties. It is possible that"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"changes could occur to these estimates, which could adversely affect the net cash flows expected to be generated from these stream and royalty interests. Refer to Note 4 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment assessment results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer control of a distinct good or service (or integrated package of goods and/or services) to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with this guidance, revenue attributable to our stream and royalty interests is generally recognized at the point in time that control of the related metal production transfers to our customers. The amount of revenue we recognize further reflects the consideration to which we are entitled under the respective stream or royalty agreement. A more detailed summary of our revenue recognition policies for our stream and royalty interests is discussed below."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more of the metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. Gold, silver and copper received under our metal streaming agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between ten days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective streaming agreement and our sales policy in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. We settle our forward sales contracts via physical delivery of the metal to the purchaser (our customer) on the settlement date specified in the contract. Under our forward sales contracts, there is a single performance obligation to sell a contractually specified volume of metal to the purchaser, and we satisfy this obligation at the point in time of physical delivery. Accordingly, revenue from our metal sales is recognized on the date of settlement, which is the date that control, custody and title to the metal transfer to the purchaser."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. We are entitled to payment for our royalty interest in a mining project based on a contractually specified commodity price (for example, a monthly or quarterly average spot price) for the period in which metal production occurred. As a royalty holder, we act as a passive entity in the production and operations of the mining project, and the third-party operator of the mining project is responsible for all mining activities, including subsequent marketing and delivery of all metal production to their ultimate customer. In all of our material royalty interest arrangements, we have concluded that we transfer control of our interest in the metal production to the operator at the point at which production occurs, and thus, the operator is our customer. We have further determined that the transfer of each unit of metal production, comprising our royalty interest, to the operator represents a separate performance obligation under the contract, and each performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time of metal production by the operator. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to our royalty interests in the period in which metal production occurs at the specified commodity price per the agreement, net of any contractually allowable offsite treatment, refining, transportation and, if applicable, mining costs."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Gold, silver and copper received under our metal streaming agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between 10 days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective streaming agreement and our sales activity in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. Temporary modifications may be made to our metal sales guidelines from time to time as required"
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"to meet our needs. Revenue from gold, silver and copper sales is recognized on the date of the settlement, which is also the date that title to the metal passes to the purchaser."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Cost of sales, which excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, is specific to our stream agreements and is the result of our purchase of gold, silver and copper for a cash payment. The cash payment for gold from Mount Milligan is the lesser of $435 per ounce or the prevailing market price of gold when purchased, while the cash payment for our other streams is a set contractual percentage of the gold, silver or copper spot price near the date of metal delivery."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Exploration costs were specific to our Peak Gold JV for exploration and advancement of the Peak Gold project as discussed further in Note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements. Exploration costs associated with the exploration and advancement of Peak Gold were expensed when incurred. As a result of the sale of our Peak Gold project as discussed further in this MD&A and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we do not expect to incur exploration costs in the future."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Our annual tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax expense, current tax assets and liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income, both as a whole and in various tax jurisdictions, for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year’s liability by taxing authorities."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"We treat global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as a period cost and therefore do not record deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our consolidated financial statements. Our deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies."
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"Our operations may involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution could result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense."

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated August 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."

The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"At June 30, 2021, the Company’s stream and royalty interest balance totaled $2.3 billion. As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its stream and royalty interests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the asset or group of assets may not be recoverable (“triggering events”). Management evaluates various qualitative factors in determining whether or not events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The factors considered include, among others, significant changes in estimates of forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices, significant changes in operators’ estimates"
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"of proven and probable reserves and other relevant information received from the operators, which may include operational or legal information that indicates production from mineral interests will not likely occur or may be significantly reduced in the future. Auditing the Company’s impairment assessment involved our subjective judgment because, in determining whether a triggering event occurred, management uses estimates that include, among others, assumptions about forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices and total future production using reserve or other relevant information reported by the operators. Significant uncertainty exists with these assumptions. Further, management’s evaluation of any new information indicating that production will not likely occur or may be significantly reduced in the future requires significant judgment."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process over the impairment assessment. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s process for identifying and evaluating potential impairment triggers and related significant assumptions and judgments. To test the Company’s impairment assessment, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions, judgments and operating data used in the Company’s analysis. Specifically, we compared forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices to available market information, and we corroborated reserve information to available operator or publicly available information. We involved our specialist and searched for and evaluated other publicly available information that corroborates or contradicts the reserve estimates or indicates that production from mineral interests will not likely occur or may be significantly reduced in the future. We also considered the professional qualifications and objectivity of management’s specialists and the reputation of the third-party operators. Further, we evaluated the reasonableness of changes to estimated proven and probable reserves using our experience with the Company’s stream and royalty interests and industry knowledge. ​"

Total consideration for the royalty is up to $41 million, of which $11 million was paid on January 29, 2020. The $11 million paid as part of the funding schedule, plus direct acquisition costs, have been recorded as an exploration stage royalty interest within Stream and royalty interests, net on our consolidated balance sheets. A future payment of up to $20 million is conditioned based on a project construction decision by Barrick and the size of the minable mineralized material on the date of the construction decision. A further future payment of up to $10 million will be made upon first production from the mining concessions."

FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"On February 25, 2019, we entered into a silver stream with Khoemacau Copper Mining (Pty.) Limited (“KCM”) for the purchase of silver produced from the Khoemacau Project (“Khoemacau”). Between November 2019 and January 2021, we completed a total of $212 million in advanced payments required to earn the base silver stream (“Silver Stream”) of 80% of payable silver produced from Khoemacau, until the delivery of 32.0 million ounces, and 40% thereafter. On April 7, 2021, we made a seventh advance payment of $10.6 million toward the option silver stream (“Option Stream”) which increased our right to receive payable silver produced from Khoemacau from a rate of 80% to 84% until the delivery of"
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"approximately 33.6 million silver ounces, and 42% thereafter. We will pay a cash price equal to 20% of the spot silver price for each ounce delivered; however, if KCM achieves mill expansion throughput levels above 13,000 tonnes per day (30% above current mill design capacity), we will pay a higher ongoing cash price for silver ounces delivered in excess of specific annual thresholds."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We have accounted for the base Silver Stream and initial funding towards the Option Stream as an asset acquisition, consistent with the treatment of our other acquired streams. The $212 million in advance payments for the base Silver Stream made during our fiscal year 2021 and 2020 and the $10.6 million toward the Option Stream, plus direct transaction costs, have been recorded as a development stage stream interest within Stream and royalty interests, net on our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021. Any further advance payments made under the Option Stream (if exercised by KCM) will be recorded as a development stage interest within Stream and royalty interests, net on our consolidated balance sheets during the period the advance payment occurs."

FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"On October 1, 2020, we announced the separation of the Wassa gold stream and the Prestea and Bogoso gold streams into two separate stream agreements effective September 30, 2020. This separation was completed to facilitate the sale by Golden Star Resources Ltd. (“Golden Star”) of the Prestea and Bogoso mines to Future Global Resources (“FGR”)."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"The Wassa stream agreement, which remains with Golden Star, continues to provide us the right to purchase 10.5% of the gold payable from the Wassa mine until the delivery of 240,000 ounces, after which the stream percentage will decrease to 5.5%. The cash purchase price for gold remains at 20% of the spot price per ounce delivered until the delivery of 240,000 ounces, and 30% of the spot price per ounce delivered thereafter. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 112,000 ounces remain to be delivered from the Wassa mine until the 240,000 ounce delivery threshold is reached."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,The Prestea and Bogoso stream agreement with FGR provides us the right to purchase 5.5% of the gold payable from the Prestea and Bogoso mines in return for a cash purchase price of 30% of the spot price per ounce delivered.
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"The material terms of both the Wassa stream agreement and the Prestea and Bogoso stream agreement, including security and the rights and obligations of both Royal Gold and Golden Star, remain substantially consistent with those terms in the original agreement. The Wassa stream is recorded as a production stage stream interest within Stream and royalty interests, net on our consolidated balance sheets and has a carrying value of $67.6 million as of June 30, 2021. The Prestea and Bogoso stream has a carrying value of $0 as of June 30, 2021."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We own the right to purchase 35% of the payable gold and 18.75% of the payable copper produced from the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine in British Columbia, Canada, which is operated by an indirect subsidiary of Centerra Gold Inc. (“Centerra”). Our carrying value for the stream interest at Mount Milligan is $490.3 million as of June 30, 2021."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"On October 30, 2019, Centerra reported that issues identified with decreasing long-term gold recoveries and increased costs in the short-to medium-term led them to record an impairment charge against their carrying value of the Mount Milligan mine under applicable accounting standards, and that it had begun a comprehensive technical review of the operation with the objective of publishing an updated National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) technical report."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"On March 26, 2020, Centerra published an updated NI 43-101 technical report for Mount Milligan which provided, among other things, a detailed update to the life of mine plan and reductions to the proven and probable reserves due to increased costs, lower expected productivities and lower process plant throughput."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Significant reductions in proven and probable reserves or mineralized material are indicators of potential impairment for our stream and royalty interests. As part of our regular asset impairment analysis during the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we determined that an impairment of our stream interest at Mount Milligan was not necessary as (i) the financial impairment taken by Centerra does not impact the mine operating performance, and (ii) the reduction in reserves and mineralized material at Mount Milligan resulted in updated gold and copper depletion rates that remain well below current and long-term consensus gold and copper prices. As of June 30, 2021, the gold and copper depletion rates at our Mount Milligan stream interest are $712 per ounce of gold and $1.53 per pound of copper. Depletion rates well below current and long-term consensus metal prices are a strong indicator the carrying value of our stream or royalty interests are recoverable and thus we concluded no impairment indicators were present as of June 30, 2021."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We own the right to purchase 6.50% of the gold produced from the Rainy River mine, which is located in northwestern Ontario, Canada and is operated by New Gold, Inc.

As of June 30, 2021, approximately 54,000 ounces of gold and approximately 699,400 ounces of silver have been delivered to us. Our carrying value for the stream interest at Rainy River is $134.0 million as of June 30, 2021."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, New Gold reported that it continued to advance a comprehensive mine optimization study that would include a review of alternative open pit and underground mining scenarios at Rainy River On February 13, 2020, New Gold reported the results of the comprehensive optimization study that included an updated mine plan, which resulted in, among other things, a reduction in gold and silver reserves and the potential to extend the underground mine life beyond calendar year 2028. New Gold published an updated NI 43-101 technical report for Rainy River on March 27, 2020, reflecting the updated mine plan and reserves."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Significant reductions in proven and probable reserves or mineralized material are indicators of potential impairment for our stream and royalty interests. As a result of the new information from New Gold, and as part of our regular asset impairment analysis, we determined that an impairment on our Rainy River stream interest was not necessary as of March 31, 2020 as the reduction in gold and silver reserves resulted in updated depletion rates that remain well below current and long-term consensus gold and silver prices. As of June 30, 2021, the gold and silver depletion rates at our Rainy River stream interest are $779 per ounce of gold and $9.07 per ounce of silver. Depletion rates well below current and long-term metal prices are a strong indicator the carrying value of our stream or royalty interests are recoverable."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Throughout calendar year 2020 and into calendar year 2021, several of our operating counterparties have instituted temporary operational curtailments due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the pandemic and resulting economic and societal impacts have made it difficult for operators to forecast expected production amounts and, at times, operators have had to withdraw or revise previously disclosed guidance. For the most part, our results of operations and financial condition have not been materially impacted by these measures to date. However, the effects of the pandemic will ultimately depend on many factors that are outside of our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, government and operator actions in response to the pandemic, and the development, availability, and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines. As a result, we are currently unable to predict the nature or extent of any future impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of developments associated with the pandemic on stream and royalty interests as part of our regular asset impairment analysis."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"In accordance with our impairment accounting policy discussed in Note 2, impairments in the carrying value of each royalty interests are measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each royalty interest exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash-flows."

FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer control of a distinct good or service (or integrated package of goods and/or services) to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with this guidance, revenue attributable to our stream interests and royalty interests is generally recognized at the point in time that control of the related metal production transfers to our customers. The amount of revenue we recognize further reflects the consideration to which we are entitled under the respective stream or royalty agreement. A more detailed summary of our revenue recognition policies for our stream and royalty interests is discussed below."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more of the metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. Gold, silver and copper received under our metal streaming agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between ten days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective streaming agreement and our sales policy in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. We settle our forward sales contracts via physical delivery of the metal to the purchaser (our customer) on the settlement date specified in the contract. Under our forward sales contracts, there is a single performance obligation to sell a contractually specified volume of metal to the purchaser, and we satisfy this obligation at the point in time of physical delivery. Accordingly, revenue from our metal sales is recognized on the date of settlement, which is the date that control, custody and title to the metal transfer to the purchaser."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. We are entitled to payment for our royalty interest in a mining project based on a contractually specified commodity price (for example, a monthly or quarterly average spot price) for the period in which metal production occurred. As a royalty holder, we act as a passive entity in the production and operations of the mining project, and the third-party operator of the mining project is responsible for all mining activities, including subsequent marketing and delivery of all metal production to their ultimate customer. In all of our material royalty interest arrangements, we have concluded that we transfer control of our interest in the metal production to the operator at the point at which production occurs, and thus, the operator is our customer. We have further determined that the transfer of each unit of metal production, comprising our royalty interest, to the operator represents a separate performance obligation under the contract, and each performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time of metal production by the operator. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to our royalty interests in the period in which metal production occurs at the specified commodity price per the agreement, net of any contractually allowable offsite treatment, refining, transportation and, if applicable, mining costs."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"For a small number of our royalty interests, we may not receive, or be entitled to receive, payment information, including production information from the operator, for the period in which metal production occurred prior to issuance of our financial statements. As a result, we may estimate revenue for these royalties based on available information, including public information, from the operator. If adequate information is not available from the operator or from other public sources before we issue our financial statements, we will recognize royalty revenue during the period in which the necessary payment information is received. Differences between estimates and actual amounts could differ significantly and are recorded in the period that the actual amounts are known. Please also refer to our “Use of Estimates” accounting policy discussed in Note 2. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, royalty revenue that was estimated or was attributable to metal production for a period prior to June 30, 2021, was not material."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,We have identified two material revenue sources in our business: stream interests and royalty interests. These identified revenue sources are consistent with our reportable segments as discussed in Note 15.

Under the 2015 LTIP, 2,500,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for future grants to officers, directors, key employees and other persons. The 2015 LTIP provides for the grant of stock options, unrestricted stock, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, SSARs and cash awards. Any of these awards may, but need not, be made as performance incentives. Stock options granted under the 2015 LTIP may be non-qualified stock options or incentive stock options."

FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,Stock-based compensation expense is included within General and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Stock option and SSARs awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock at the date of grant. Stock option and SSARs awards granted to officers, key employees and other persons vest based on one to three years of continuous service. Stock option and SSARs awards have 10-year contractual terms."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"To determine stock-based compensation expense for stock options and SSARs, the fair value of each stock option and SSAR is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option pricing model for all periods presented. The Black-Scholes model requires key assumptions to determine fair value. Those key assumptions during the fiscal year 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants are noted in the following table:"
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,Weighted-average expected volatility
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,Weighted-average expected life in years
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,Our expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over the expected option term. Our expected option term is determined by historical exercise patterns along with other known employee or company information at the time of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond at the time of grant with a term approximate to the expected option term.
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"A summary of stock option activity for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, is presented below."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $41.92, $17.42 and $24.12, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $0, $1.3 million, and $0.7 million, respectively."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"As of June 30, 2021, there was approximately $0.1 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years."

The total intrinsic value of SSARs exercised during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $0.1 million, $4.6 million, and $2.8 million, respectively."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"As of June 30, 2021, there was approximately $2.4 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested SSARs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"During fiscal year 2021, officers and certain employees were granted shares of restricted common stock that can only be earned upon the achievement of certain pre-defined performance measures. Specifically, for performance shares granted in fiscal year 2021, one-half of the shares awarded may vest upon our achievement of annual growth in Net Gold Equivalent Ounces (“Net GEOs”) (“GEO Shares”). The second one-half of performance shares granted in fiscal year 2021 may vest based on our total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the TSRs of other members of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) (“TSR Shares”). GEO Shares and TSR Shares may vest by linear interpolation in a range between zero shares if neither threshold Net GEO and TSR metric is met; to 100% of GEO Shares and TSR Shares awarded if both target Net GEO and TSR metrics are met; to 200% of the Net GEO and TSR Shares awarded if both the maximum Net GEO and TSR metrics are met. The GEO Shares will expire in five years from the date of grant if the performance measure is not met, while the TSR Shares will expire in three years from the date of grant if the TSR market condition and three year service condition are not met."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We measure the fair value of the GEO Shares based upon the market price of our common stock as of the date of grant. The measurement date for the GEO Shares will be determined at such time that the performance goals are attained or that it is probable they will be attained. At such time that it is probable that a performance condition will be achieved, compensation expense will be measured by the number of shares that will ultimately be earned based on the grant date market price of our common stock. For shares that were previously estimated to be probable of vesting and are no longer deemed to be probable of vesting, compensation expense is reversed during the period in which it is determined they are no longer probable of vesting. Interim recognition of compensation expense will be made at such time as management can reasonably estimate the number of shares that will be earned."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,We measured the grant date fair value of the TSR Shares using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of the TSR Shares ($82.30 per share) is multiplied by the target number (100%) of TSR Shares granted to determine total stock-based compensation expense. Total stock-based compensation expense of the TSR Shares is amortized on a straight-line basis
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"over the requisite service period, or three years. Stock-based compensation expense for the TSR Shares is recognized provided the requisite service period is rendered, regardless of when, if ever, the TSR market condition is satisfied. We will reverse previously recognized stock-based compensation expense attributable to the TSR Shares only if the requisite service period is not met."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"A summary of the status of our unvested Performance Shares at maximum (200%) attainment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, is presented below:"
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"As of June 30, 2021, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to Performance Shares was approximately $2.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over the average remaining vesting period of 2.1 years."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Officers, non-executive directors and certain employees may be granted shares of restricted stock that vest on continued service alone (“Restricted Stock”). During fiscal year 2021, officers and certain employees were granted 19,630 shares of Restricted Stock. Restricted Stock granted to officers and certain employees vest over three years beginning after a two-year holding period from the date of grant with one-third of the shares vesting in years three, four and five, respectively. Also, our non-executive directors were granted 6,744 shares of Restricted Stock during fiscal year 2021. The non-executive directors’ shares of Restricted Stock vest 50% immediately and 50% one year after the date of grant."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,We measure the fair value of the Restricted Stock based upon the market price of our common stock as of the date of grant. Restricted Stock is amortized over the applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. Unvested shares of Restricted Stock are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment or service.
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"A summary of the status of our unvested Restricted Stock for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, is presented below:"
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"As of June 30, 2021, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to Restricted Stock was approximately $4.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 3.2 years."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Basic earnings per common share were computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, considering the effect of participating securities. Unvested stock-based compensation awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Our unvested restricted stock awards contain non-forfeitable dividend rights and participate equally with common stock with respect to dividends issued or declared. Our unexercised stock options, unexercised SSARs and unvested performance stock do not contain rights to dividends. Under the two-class method, the earnings used to determine basic earnings per common share are reduced by an amount allocated to participating securities.

FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"We review the measurement of our deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date. Considering all available positive and negative evidence, including but not limited to recent earnings history and forecasted future results, the Company believes it is more likely-than-not that all net deferred tax assets not currently burdened with a valuation allowance will be fully realized. As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, we recorded a valuation allowance of $61.9 million and $60.6 million, respectively. The valuation allowance remaining at June 30, 2021 is attributable to US foreign tax credits, Swiss amortizable tax goodwill, and capital loss and other tax attribute carryforwards in non-US subsidiaries."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"At June 30, 2021 and 2020, we had $0.1 million of net operating loss carry forwards. The majority of the tax loss carry forwards are in jurisdictions that allow a twenty-year carry forward period. As a result, these losses do not begin to expire until the 2038 tax year, and the Company anticipates the losses will be fully utilized."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, we had $0.7 million and $25.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before 2017. As a result of possible settlements with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits may decrease to $0 in the next 12 months."
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax expense. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties was $0.3 million and $12.6 million, respectively.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, we utilize a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:"
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We acquire and manage precious metal streams, royalties, and similar interests. We seek to acquire existing stream and royalty interests or finance projects that are in production or in the development stage in exchange for stream or royalty interests."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,We manage our business under two segments:
MANAGEMENT,ListItem,"Acquisition and Management of Stream Interests — A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. As of June 30, 2021, we owned eight stream interests, which are on six producing properties and two development stage properties. Stream interests accounted for 69% and 72% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30 2021, and 2020, respectively. We expect stream interests to continue representing a significant portion of our total revenue."
MANAGEMENT,ListItem,"Acquisition and Management of Royalty Interests — Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. As of June 30, 2021, we owned royalty interests on 35 producing properties, 15 development stage properties and 129 exploration stage properties, of which we consider 50 to be evaluation stage projects. We use “evaluation stage” to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the search for reserves. Royalty interests accounted for 31% and 28% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests, and we generally are not required to contribute to capital costs, exploration costs, environmental costs or other operating costs on those properties."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We are continually reviewing opportunities to grow our portfolio, whether through the creation or acquisition of new or existing stream or royalty interests or other acquisition activity. We generally have acquisition opportunities in various stages of review. Our review process may include, for example, engaging consultants and advisors to analyze an opportunity; analysis of technical, financial, legal, and other confidential information of an opportunity; submission of indications of interest and term sheets; participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations; and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold, silver, copper, and other metals. Metal prices have fluctuated widely in recent years and we expect this volatility to continue. The marketability and price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, and significant changes in metal prices can have a material effect on our revenue."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, average metal prices and percentages of revenue by metal were as follows:"
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Throughout calendar year 2020 and into calendar year 2021, several of our operating counterparties have instituted temporary operational curtailments due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the pandemic and resulting economic and societal impacts have made it difficult for operators to forecast expected production amounts and, at times, operators have had to withdraw or revise previously disclosed guidance. For the most part, our results of operations and financial condition have not been materially impacted by these measures to date. However, the effects of the pandemic will ultimately depend on many factors that are outside of our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the emergence of variant strains of the virus, government and operator actions in response to the pandemic, and the development, availability, and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines. As a result, we are currently unable to predict the nature or extent of any future impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of developments associated with the pandemic on stream and royalty interests as part of our regular asset impairment analysis."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"On September 30, 2020, we announced an agreement with Kinross to sell our interest in the Manh Choh Project (formerly known as the Peak Gold Project) and our common share position in Contango Ore, Inc.

Consideration received for the sale of these interests included cash of $61.3 million, an incremental 28% net smelter return royalty on silver produced from an area of interest which includes the current Manh Choh Project resource area, and an incremental 1% net smelter return royalty on certain State of Alaska mining claims acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of Contango in the transaction. Peak Gold, LLC retains the right to acquire 50% of the incremental 28% net smelter return royalty on silver for $4 million."

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recorded net income attributable to Royal Gold stockholders of $302.5 million, or $4.61 per basic share and $4.60 per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to Royal Gold stockholders of $199.3 million, or $3.04 per basic share and $3.03 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in our earnings per share was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in revenue, (ii) a one-time gain attributable to the sale of our Peak Gold JV interest during the September 2020 quarter and (iii) various discrete income tax benefits recognized during the September 2020 and June 2021 quarters. These increases were partially offset by increases in our cost of sales and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, each discussed further below."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized total revenue of $615.9 million, which is comprised of stream revenue of $424.0 million and royalty revenue of $191.9 million, at an average gold price of $1,849 per ounce, an average silver price of $25.38 per ounce and an average copper price of $3.60 per pound, compared to total revenue of $498.8 million, which is comprised of stream revenue of $359.9 million and royalty revenue of $138.9 million, at an average gold price of $1,560 per ounce, an average silver price of $16.90 per ounce and an average copper price of $2.57 per pound, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020."

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"The increase in our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, resulted primarily from an increase in the average gold, silver and copper prices compared to the prior period and an increase in production within the royalty segment."

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Cost of sales increased to $92.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $83.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the gold, silver and copper prices and an increase in copper sales at Mount Milligan when compared to the prior period. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in gold sales at Mount Milligan and Andacollo when compared to the prior period. Cost of sales, which excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, is specific to our stream agreements and is the result of our purchase of gold, silver and copper for a cash payment. The cash payment for gold from Mount Milligan is the lesser of $435 per ounce or the prevailing market price of gold when purchased, while the cash payment for our other streams is a set contractual percentage of the gold, silver or copper (Mount Milligan) spot price near the date of metal delivery."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"General and administrative costs decreased to $28.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $30.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to additional non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $3.3 million recognized in the prior year period due to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in connection with the retirement of our former President and Chief Executive Officer and our former Vice President and General Counsel in January 2020."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Exploration costs decreased to $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $5.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Exploration costs were specific to the exploration and advancement of the Peak Gold JV. On September 30, 2020, we sold our Peak Gold JV interest which is discussed earlier in this MD&A and Note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $183.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $175.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher copper sales at Mount Milligan and an increase in depletion rates at Mount Milligan through the six months ended December 31, 2020, as previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization was offset by a decrease in gold sales at Mount Milligan and Andacollo."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We recognized a gain in fair value changes in equity securities of $6.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to a gain in fair value changes in equity securities of $1.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of marketable equity securities as discussed further in Note 5 of our notes to consolidated financial statements."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Interest and other expense decreased to $6.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $9.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense as a result of a decrease in average debt amounts outstanding during the current period when compared to the prior period. Refer to Note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized income tax expense totaling $36.9 million, compared with an income tax benefit of $3.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.9% during the current period, compared with (1.9%) in the prior period. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, was primarily impacted by the release of uncertain tax liabilities resulting from settlement agreements with foreign tax authorities in various jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, was primarily impacted by a net step-up of tax assets due to the enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland (Swiss Tax Reform) and the release of an uncertain tax liability resulting from a settlement agreement with a foreign tax authority."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"At June 30, 2021, we had current assets of $297.1 million compared to current liabilities of $52.1 million resulting in working capital of $245.0 million and a current ratio of 6 to 1. This compares to current assets of $362.2 million and current liabilities of $43.6 million at June 30, 2020, resulting in working capital of $318.6 million and a current ratio of approximately 8 to 1. The decrease in our working capital was primarily attributable to the repayment of our outstanding debt, which is discussed further below under “Summary of Cash Flows.”"
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, liquidity needs were met from $407.2 million in net cash provided by operating activities and our available cash resources. As of June 30, 2021, we had $1 billion available and no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Working capital, combined with available capacity under our revolving credit facility, resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of total liquidity at June 30, 2021. Refer to Note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and below (“Recent Liquidity and Capital Resource Developments”) for further discussion on our debt. In August 2021, we borrowed $100 million under our revolving credit facility for business development activities and have $900 million available."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We believe that our current financial resources and operating cash flows will be adequate to cover our operating needs for the foreseeable future. Our current financial resources are also available to fund dividends and for acquisitions of stream and royalty interests, including any conditional funding schedules. Our long-term capital requirements are primarily affected by our ongoing acquisition activities. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review. In the event of one or more substantial stream or royalty interest or other acquisitions, we may seek additional debt or equity financing as necessary. We occasionally borrow and repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and may do so in the future."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Please refer to our risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risks that may impact our liquidity and capital resources."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"On July 7, 2021, we entered into a fourth amendment to our revolving credit facility dated as of June 2, 2017. The amendment extends the maturity date from June 3, 2024, to July 7, 2026, adds provisions to provide for the eventual replacement of LIBOR and makes certain changes to the lenders under the agreement."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"On November 17, 2020, we announced an increase in our annual dividend for calendar year 2021 from $1.12 to $1.20, payable on a quarterly basis of $0.30 per share. The newly declared dividend is 7% higher than the dividend paid during calendar year 2020. We have steadily increased our annual dividend for 20 years, or since calendar year 2001. We expect to pay our annual dividend using cash on hand."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $407.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $340.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from our stream and royalty interests, net of cost of sales and production taxes, of approximately $86.1 million over the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This increase was offset by $27.4 million of higher cash taxes paid, net of refunds over the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in cash taxes paid during the current period is primarily attributable to an increase in required estimated tax payments due to increased taxable income and payments that were deferred due to COVID-19."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Net cash used in investing activities totaled $116.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $152.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $49.2 million received for the sale of our Peak Gold JV investment and $21.3 million for the sale of equity securities. This decrease was partially offset by the $18.0 million KCM drew against the subordinated debt facility."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Net cash used in financing activities totaled $383.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $11.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in repayments on our revolving credit facility. We repaid $305.0 million on our revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $115.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021, were as follows:"
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,The above table does not include stream commitments as discussed in Note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements. We believe we will be able to fund all current obligations from net cash provided by operating activities.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,We do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Listed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Please also refer to Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"The preparation of our financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators of the properties on which we hold stream and royalty interests. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long-lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. These estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we recognize revenue or charge depreciation, depletion and amortization to earnings. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Differences between estimates and actual amounts are adjusted and recorded in the period that the actual amounts are known."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Stream and royalty interests include acquired stream and royalty interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. The costs of acquired stream and royalty interests are capitalized as tangible assets as such interests do not meet the definition of a financial asset."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Production stage stream and royalty interests are depleted using the units of production method over the life of the mineral property (as stream sales occur or royalty payments are recognized), which are estimated using proven and probable reserves as provided by the operator. Development stage mineral properties, which are not yet in production, are not depleted until the property begins production. Exploration stage mineral properties, where there are no proven and probable reserves, are not depleted. At such time as the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable reserves, the mineral property is depleted over its life, using proven and probable reserves."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value of stream and royalty interests in production and development stage mineral properties is evaluated based upon estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from each stream and royalty interest using estimates of proven and probable reserves and other relevant information received from the operators. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in exploration stage mineral properties in the event of significant decreases in the price of gold, silver, copper and other metals, and whenever new information regarding the mineral properties is obtained from the operator indicating that production will not likely occur or may be reduced in the future, thus potentially affecting the future recoverability of our stream or royalty interests. Impairments in the carrying value of each property are measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each property exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Estimates of gold, silver, copper, and other metal prices, and operators’ estimates of proven and probable reserves or mineralized material related to our stream or royalty properties are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our investment in these stream and royalty interests in mineral properties. It is possible that"
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"changes could occur to these estimates, which could adversely affect the net cash flows expected to be generated from these stream and royalty interests. Refer to Note 4 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment assessment results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer control of a distinct good or service (or integrated package of goods and/or services) to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with this guidance, revenue attributable to our stream and royalty interests is generally recognized at the point in time that control of the related metal production transfers to our customers. The amount of revenue we recognize further reflects the consideration to which we are entitled under the respective stream or royalty agreement. A more detailed summary of our revenue recognition policies for our stream and royalty interests is discussed below."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more of the metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. Gold, silver and copper received under our metal streaming agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between ten days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective streaming agreement and our sales policy in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. We settle our forward sales contracts via physical delivery of the metal to the purchaser (our customer) on the settlement date specified in the contract. Under our forward sales contracts, there is a single performance obligation to sell a contractually specified volume of metal to the purchaser, and we satisfy this obligation at the point in time of physical delivery. Accordingly, revenue from our metal sales is recognized on the date of settlement, which is the date that control, custody and title to the metal transfer to the purchaser."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. We are entitled to payment for our royalty interest in a mining project based on a contractually specified commodity price (for example, a monthly or quarterly average spot price) for the period in which metal production occurred. As a royalty holder, we act as a passive entity in the production and operations of the mining project, and the third-party operator of the mining project is responsible for all mining activities, including subsequent marketing and delivery of all metal production to their ultimate customer. In all of our material royalty interest arrangements, we have concluded that we transfer control of our interest in the metal production to the operator at the point at which production occurs, and thus, the operator is our customer. We have further determined that the transfer of each unit of metal production, comprising our royalty interest, to the operator represents a separate performance obligation under the contract, and each performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time of metal production by the operator. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to our royalty interests in the period in which metal production occurs at the specified commodity price per the agreement, net of any contractually allowable offsite treatment, refining, transportation and, if applicable, mining costs."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Gold, silver and copper received under our metal streaming agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between 10 days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective streaming agreement and our sales activity in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. Temporary modifications may be made to our metal sales guidelines from time to time as required"
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"to meet our needs. Revenue from gold, silver and copper sales is recognized on the date of the settlement, which is also the date that title to the metal passes to the purchaser."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Cost of sales, which excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, is specific to our stream agreements and is the result of our purchase of gold, silver and copper for a cash payment. The cash payment for gold from Mount Milligan is the lesser of $435 per ounce or the prevailing market price of gold when purchased, while the cash payment for our other streams is a set contractual percentage of the gold, silver or copper spot price near the date of metal delivery."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Exploration costs were specific to our Peak Gold JV for exploration and advancement of the Peak Gold project as discussed further in Note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements. Exploration costs associated with the exploration and advancement of Peak Gold were expensed when incurred. As a result of the sale of our Peak Gold project as discussed further in this MD&A and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we do not expect to incur exploration costs in the future."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Our annual tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax expense, current tax assets and liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income, both as a whole and in various tax jurisdictions, for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year’s liability by taxing authorities."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"We treat global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as a period cost and therefore do not record deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our consolidated financial statements. Our deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Our operations may involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution could result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"This report and our other public communications include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from these statements."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “forecast,” “potential,” “intend,” “continue,” “project,” or negatives of these words or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: statements about our expected financial performance and outlook, including sale volume, revenue, expenses, tax rates, earnings or cash flow; operators’ expected operating and financial performance, including production, deliveries, mine plans and reserves, development, cash flows and capital expenditures; planned and potential acquisitions or dispositions, including funding schedules and conditions; liquidity, financing and stockholder returns; our overall investment portfolio; macroeconomic and market conditions including the impacts of COVID-19; prices for gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metals; potential impairments; or tax changes."
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: a lower-price environment for gold, silver, copper, nickel or other metals; operating activities or financial performance of properties on which we hold stream or royalty interests, including variations between actual and forecasted performance, operators’ ability to complete projects on schedule and as planned, changes to mine plans and reserves, liquidity needs, mining and environmental hazards, labor disputes, distribution and supply chain disruptions, permitting and licensing issues, contractual issues involving our stream or royalty agreements, or operational disruptions due to COVID-19, including due to variant strains of the virus; risks associated with doing business in foreign countries; increased competition for stream and royalty interests; environmental risks, included those caused by climate change; potential cyber-attacks, including ransomware; our ability to identify, finance, value and complete acquisitions; adverse economic and market conditions; changes in laws or regulations governing us, operators or operating properties; changes in management and key employees; and other factors described elsewhere in this report. Most of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control."
