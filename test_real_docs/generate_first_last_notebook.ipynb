      "+ Colgate Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Colgate”) is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling products globally that make people’s and their pets’ lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) strategies across our organization\n",
      "+ We are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long term growth\n",
      "+ Operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approximately 70% of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world\n",
      "+ The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. Through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct to consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world\n",
      "+ On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non GAAP financial measures and the Company’s use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see “Non GAAP Financial Measures” and “Market Share Information” below\n",
      "+ The COVID 19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID 19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and continue to impact economic activity around the world. We have a well established Crisis Management Team (“CMT”) process, and the CMT, together with our senior management team and Colgate people around the world, continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by COVID 19\n",
      "+ During the COVID 19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience “stay at home” orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID 19, and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic, resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations. The situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography, as the impact of COVID 19 remains significant in many countries throughout the world, including China, Thailand, and Vietnam, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities. Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity\n",
      "+ The health, safety and well being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. We have implemented additional health and safety measures consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements to help ensure employee safety in our offices, production facilities, warehouses and technology centers, often at additional cost. These measures may include: health and temperature screening, social distancing and personal protective equipment protocols, hand washing, contact tracing, enhanced cleaning procedures, respiratory hygiene, education and, in some instances, testing and/or vaccination requirements. In addition, during the COVID 19 pandemic, we have seen increased instances of absenteeism and, in some cases, we have experienced some limited production facility closures and related supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses\n",
      "+ We saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry loading and increased consumption of our products. While consumer demand for most of these categories softened during 2021 and in the three months ended March 31, 2022, they still remained above historical levels. We believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID 19. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category, channel and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID 19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions. At the same time, during the COVID 19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online\n",
      "+ COVID 19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID 19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the COVID 19 pandemic. These uncertainties include: the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies, the availability and widespread distribution and use of COVID 19 vaccines, the emergence and spread of COVID 19 variants, the timing and impact of consumer pantry loading and destocking activity in certain markets, product demand trends and the impact of COVID 19 on the global economy, including as a result of inflation, and supply chain disruptions. COVID 19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID 19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. We expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with COVID 19 to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022\n",
      "+ While we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and third parties, uncertainty resulting from COVID 19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs\n",
      "+ Due primarily to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying values of the indefinite lived trademark and goodwill of its Filorga reporting unit (together, “Filorga intangible assets”) to their respective fair values. While the fair values of the Filorga intangible assets continue to approximate their respective carrying values, there remains considerable uncertainty in the duty free and travel retail channels which could result in additional impairment charges in future periods. We continue to believe in the strength of the Filorga brand and remain confident about its longer term growth opportunities\n",
      "+ For more information about the anticipated COVID 19 impact, see “Outlook” below\n",
      "+ The war in Ukraine, which began in February 2022, and the related geopolitical tensions has had and continues to have a significant impact on our business in Ukraine, though it has not been material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The safety of our employees and partners in Ukraine has been and remains our first priority. While our ability to do business in Ukraine has been significantly impacted, we remain committed to rebuilding our business there and to providing access to essential products to people in the region. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, we made the decision to suspend the importation and sales of all products in Russia other than essential health and hygiene products for everyday use and ceased all capital investments, media, advertising and promotional activities in Russia. To date, these actions have not had a material impact on our business (including our Eurasia business), results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and the three months ended March 31, 2022, our Eurasia business constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated business (the majority of which was Russia). We also continue to monitor the impact of sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the war in Ukraine. The situation is rapidly evolving and significant uncertainties remain regarding the full impact of the war and the related impact on the global economy and geopolitical relations generally, and on our business in particular. We have seen and expect to continue to see the war’s impact on the global economy and our business including, among other things, the cost of raw and packaging materials and commodities (including the price of oil), supply chain and logistics challenges and foreign currency volatility. For more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to the war in Ukraine, see “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report and Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2021\n",
      "+ To achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long term profitable growth through innovation on our core businesses; leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories; expanding in high growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics, enabling us to be more responsive in today’s rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct to consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products\n",
      "+ We are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation\n",
      "+ The investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding the growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health\n",
      "+ On January 27, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a targeted productivity program (the “2022 Global Productivity Initiative”). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards the Company’s strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in the Company’s operations and streamline the Company’s supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by mid year 2023, is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, in the range of $200 to $240 ($170 to $200 aftertax), which is currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (75%); asset related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write downs (15%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 80% to 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Annualized pretax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110 ($70 to $85 aftertax), once all projects are approved and implemented. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below\n",
      "+ In the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company incurred pretax costs of $82 (aftertax costs of $65) resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative\n",
      "+ Looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. We also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry, higher eCommerce demand and the impact of the war in Ukraine. We expect this difficult cost environment to continue throughout 2022\n",
      "+ While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion\n",
      "+ We have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain environmental, sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct to consumer businesses. These trends have been magnified due to COVID 19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses, such as eCommerce. This rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers\n",
      "+ In addition, given that approximately 70% of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. As discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and our funding the growth and revenue growth management initiatives, including additional pricing, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results\n",
      "+ As discussed above, we continue to closely monitor the impact of the war in Ukraine and COVID 19 on our business. During 2020 as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners. While consumer demand for most of these categories softened during 2021 and in the three months ended March 31, 2022, they still remained above historical levels. We believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID 19. We expect increased volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term. COVID 19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID 19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of COVID 19, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of COVID 19’s impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to the war in Ukraine and COVID 19, see “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2021\n",
      "+ In summary, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, broad based experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long term profitable growth through innovation within our core businesses, leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories, expanding in high growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges presented by COVID 19 and increase shareholder value over time\n",

      "+ On June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin off of products from its women’s health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a distribution of Organon’s publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The distribution is expected to qualify as tax free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The established brands included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non opioid pain management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of Merck’s diversified brands franchise. Merck’s existing research pipeline programs will continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned. The historical results of the women’s health, biosimilars and established brands businesses that were contributed to Organon in the spin off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin off (see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements)\n",
      "+ Below is a summary of significant business development activity thus far in 2021. See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information\n",
      "+ In January 2021, Merck entered into an exclusive license and research collaboration agreement with Artiva Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Artiva) to discover, develop and manufacture CAR NK cells that target certain solid tumors using Artiva’s proprietary platform. Merck and Artiva agreed to engage in up to three different research programs, each covering a collaboration target. Merck has sole responsibility for all development and commercialization activities (including regulatory filing and approval). Under the terms of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment of $30 million, which was included in\n",
      "+ expenses in the first six months of 2021, for license and other rights for the first two collaboration targets and agreed to make another upfront payment of $15 million for license and other rights for the third collaboration target when it is selected by Merck and accepted by Artiva. In addition, Artiva is eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments and tiered royalties on future sales\n",
      "+ In March 2021, Merck and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) entered into an agreement to jointly develop and commercialize long acting treatments in HIV that combine Merck’s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, and Gilead’s investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir. The collaboration will initially focus on long acting oral formulations and long acting injectable formulations of these combination products, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. There was no upfront payment made by either party upon entering into the agreement\n",
      "+ In April 2021, Merck acquired Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. (Pandion), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases, for total consideration of $1.9 billion. Pandion is advancing a pipeline of precision immune modulators targeting critical immune control nodes\n",
      "+ Overall, in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, Merck is focused on protecting the safety of its employees, ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of an antiviral therapy, supporting efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of SARS CoV 2/COVID 19 medicines and vaccines (see below), and supporting health care providers and Merck’s communities. Although COVID 19 related disruptions negatively affected results for the second quarter and first six months of 2021, Merck continues to experience strong global underlying demand across its business\n",
      "+ In the second quarter and first six months of 2021, the estimated negative impact of the COVID 19 pandemic to Merck’s Pharmaceutical sales was approximately $400 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. There was no impact to Animal Health sales. In the second quarter of 2020, the estimated negative impact of the COVID 19 pandemic to Merck’s sales was $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion for Pharmaceutical revenue and $100 million for Animal Health revenue. The impact to sales in the first quarter of 2020 was immaterial. Roughly 75% of Merck’s Pharmaceutical segment revenue is comprised of physician administered products, which, despite strong underlying demand, have been affected by social distancing measures and fewer well visits\n",
      "+ In April 2021, Merck announced it was discontinuing the development of MK 7110 (formerly known as CD24Fc) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID 19 (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). This decision resulted in charges of $37 million and $207 million to\n",
      "+ Operating expenses reflect a minor positive effect in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 as investments in COVID 19 related research programs largely offset the favorable impact of lower spending in other areas due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Operating expenses were positively affected in the second quarter and first six months of 2020 by approximately $300 million and $400 million, respectively, primarily driven by lower promotional and selling costs, as well as lower research and development expenses due to the COVID 19 pandemic\n",
      "+ Merck continues to believe that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic, and that while certain negative impacts will persist, the trend will continue to improve. For the full year of 2021, Merck assumes a net unfavorable impact to sales of less than 3% due to the COVID 19 pandemic, all of which relates to the Pharmaceutical segment. In addition, for the full year of 2021, Merck expects a negligible impact to operating expenses, as spending on the development of its COVID 19 antiviral program, molnupiravir, is expected to offset the favorable impact of lower spending in other areas due to the COVID 19 pandemic\n",
      "+ In June 2021, Merck announced a procurement agreement with the U.S. government for molnupiravir (MK 4482/EIDD 2801). Molnupiravir is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial, the MOVe OUT study, for the treatment of non hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. Merck has also initiated a clinical program to evaluate molnupiravir for post exposure prophylaxis. Through the agreement, if molnupiravir receives Emergency Use Authorization or approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Merck will receive approximately $1.2 billion to supply approximately 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir to the U.S. government. This procurement of molnupiravir will be supported in whole or in part with federal funds. Merck has been investing at risk to support development and scale up production of molnupiravir and expects to have more than 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021. Merck also plans to submit applications for emergency use or approval to regulatory bodies outside of the U.S. and is currently in discussions with other countries interested in advance purchase agreements for molnupiravir. Merck is committed to providing timely access to molnupiravir globally and intends to implement a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank data that recognizes countries’ relative ability to finance their public health response to the pandemic. As part of its access strategy, Merck has also entered into non exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with established generic manufacturers to accelerate availability of molnupiravir in low and middle income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. Merck is developing molnupiravir in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback Bio). If approved, Merck will be the principal on sales transactions, recognizing sales and related costs, with profit sharing amounts recorded within\n",
      "+ . Profits from the collaboration will be split equally between the partners\n",
      "+ In March 2021, Merck announced it had entered into multiple agreements to support efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of SARS CoV 2/COVID 19 medicines and vaccines. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will provide Merck with funding to adapt and make available a number of existing manufacturing facilities for the production of SARS CoV 2/COVID 19 vaccines and medicines. Merck has also entered into agreements to support the manufacturing and supply of Johnson & Johnson’s SARS CoV 2/COVID 19 vaccine. Merck will use its facilities in the U.S. to produce drug substance, formulate and fill vials of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine\n",
      "+ Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company’s sales performance in the first six months of 2021 was negatively affected by other cost reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales performance\n",
      "+ U.S. plus international may not equal total due to rounding\n",
      "+ Worldwide sales grew 22% to $11.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and rose 12% to $22.0 billion in the first six months of 2021. Revenue performance in both periods reflects higher sales in the oncology franchise primarily driven by strong growth of\n",
      "+ (pembrolizumab) and increased alliance revenue from Lynparza (olaparib), as well as higher sales of vaccines, including\n",
      "+ (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live). Higher sales of certain hospital acute care products, including\n",
      "+ (letermovir), as well as higher sales of Animal Health products also drove revenue growth in the second quarter and first six months of 2021. As discussed above, the COVID 19 pandemic unfavorably affected sales in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, but to a lesser extent than in the comparable periods of 2020, which benefited year over year sales growth\n",
      "+ Revenue growth in both periods was partially offset by lower sales of diabetes products\n",

The Phase 3 portion of the global MOVe OUT trial studying molnupiravir in non hospitalized adult patients with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes is underway.

      "+ In April 2021, Merck announced the discontinuation of development of MK 7110 (formerly known as CD24Fc) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID 19. Merck acquired MK 7110 in December 2020 through its acquisition of OncoImmune, a privately held clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. In 2021, Merck received feedback from the FDA that additional data would be needed to support a potential Emergency Use Authorization application and therefore the Company did not expect MK 7110 would become available until the first half of 2022. Given this timeline and the technical, clinical and regulatory uncertainties, the availability of a number of medicines for patients hospitalized with COVID 19, and the need to concentrate Merck’s resources on accelerating the development and manufacture of the most viable therapeutics and vaccines, Merck decided to discontinue development of MK 7110 for the treatment of COVID 19. Due to the discontinuation, the Company recorded charges of $37 million and $207 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively, which are reflected in\n",
