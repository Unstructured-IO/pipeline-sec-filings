The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including final approval by the Company\u2019s board of directors, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and a tax opinion from external counsel, and other customary conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control, could delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in the completion of the spin-off or any change to the anticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction, or delay the time at which such benefits are realized. There can also be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the spin-off is completed, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related restructuring transactions) will not exceed the anticipated amounts. Whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the pendency of the transaction may impose challenges on the Company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the transaction; the impact on the Company\u2019s ability to retain talent; and potential impacts on the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers, employees, regulators and other counterparties. In addition, while it is intended that the transaction would be tax-free to the Company\u2019s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off was ultimately determined to be taxable, either the Company, Health Care business, or the Company\u2019s stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our common stock."

The decisions that have been issued to date have been narrowly tailored and appeals have been filed in some of the cases. While the litigation is ongoing, a number of manufacturers have restricted access to the 340B ceiling price for drugs dispensed at contract pharmacies. It is not yet clear how the litigation will resolve. If 340B ceiling prices are not required to be offered for drugs dispensed at contract pharmacies or the requirements for participation by 340B covered entities make participation in the program less beneficial, our 340B Program-related offerings may become less useful to 340B covered entities, and our 340B Program-related businesses could decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, uncertainty around the 340B Program could lead to lower levels of participation by 340B covered entities, which could reduce demand for our 340B Program-related businesses, which could adversely affect our business.

These changes may increase our medical and other covered benefits costs, may affect the way we price our products and services and estimate our medical and other covered benefits costs and may require us to change our operations, including by withdrawing from certain geographies where we do not have a significant presence across our businesses or are unable to collaborate or contract with providers on acceptable terms.
